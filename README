Flash plugin wrapper library
============================

This library was written as a hack to let an arbitrary GTK application
embed the Flash browser plugin, and use it to play back Flash content.

I'm putting it up here in the event that someone may find it useful as
a reference as to how you may be able to trick browser plugins to run
in your own app.
